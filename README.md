## **Description**

*Rebel Hearts* is a linear action-platformer with strong puzzle elements, featuring two distinct yet complementary characters: Dari and Rai. Set in a broken world, players will explore a series of varied districts, each with unique gameplay mechanics and narrative themes. As they navigate this world, Dari and Rai will not only face environmental challenges but will also come to terms with their evolving relationship, which forms the emotional core of the game.

The story explores themes of isolation, self-discovery, acceptance, and love, focusing on the unexpected journey of two individuals who, in their quest to escape their pasts, accidentally change the world around them. Dari, a non-human created in a lab, is a unique and unpredictable protagonist, while Rai, a human, stands as the first person to see her for who she truly is.

The game ramps up in difficulty and complexity, offering a blend of platforming, combat, and environmental puzzles. Players can switch between Dari and Rai to solve puzzles, taking advantage of each character’s distinct abilities. Dari excels at platforming, while Rai is a combat expert, although both characters can engage in both aspects of the gameplay.
